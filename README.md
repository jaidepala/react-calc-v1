1. Calculator App.
    Here you can do simple math calculations.
    One thing that seems to be missing in most calculators,
    is after you've done your calculation, if you want to do 
    a different operation, you need to re-enter the parameters,
    so this calculator overcame, that by allowing the sign to
    change, and on the basis of the sign the appropriate 
    calculation would be done.
    
2. Series Listing App.
    You can view a lot of TV Series, and filter them on the basis
    of the channel/provider hosting them. 
    DOESN'T LET YOU WATCH THE ACTUAL SERIES, SILLY.
    Will be providing an in-depth summary of the episode of each
    series in the future.
