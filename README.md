    Here you can do simple math calculations. One thing that seems to be missing in most calculators, is after 
    you've done your calculation, if you want to do a different operation, you need to re-enter the parameters, 
    so this calculator overcame, that by allowing the sign to change, and on the basis of the sign
    the appropriate calculation would be done.
    
    Just a heads up:
    The "." button doesn't do shit.
    
### Series Listing App.
    You can view a lot of TV Series, and filter them on the basis of the channel/provider hosting them. 
    DOESN'T LET YOU WATCH THE ACTUAL SERIES, SILLY. Will be providing an in-depth summary of the episode 
    of each series in the future.
